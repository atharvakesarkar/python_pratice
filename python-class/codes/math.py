# # Python Math
# # Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

# # The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

# x = min(5, 10, 25)
# y = max(5, 10, 25)

# print(x)
# print(y)

# # The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
# x = abs(-7)

# print(x)

# The Math Module
# # Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

# import math

# x = math.sqrt(64)

# print(x)


# #  It rounds the number UP to the next whole number.

# import math
# print(math.ceil(4.2)) 
# print(math.ceil(7.8)) 


# #It rounds the number DOWN to the previous whole number.

# import math
# print(math.floor(4.9)) 
# print(math.floor(7.1)) 

# # The math.pi constant, returns the value of PI (3.14...):
# import math
# x = math.pi
# print(x)
