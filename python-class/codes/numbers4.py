# # There are three numeric types in Python:
# eg:
# x = 1    # int
# y = 2.8  # float
# z = 2+1j   # complex. In Python, a complex number is a number that has a real part and an imaginary  part,   written in the form a + bj, where a and b are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit (√-1).


# To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# # Int
# # Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

# eg.
# x = +1
# y = 35656222554887711
# z = -3255522

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# Float
# Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
# eg.
# x = 1.10456756564343556865633656
# y = 1.0
# z = -35.59
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# # Complex
# # Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
# x = 5j
# # y =  3+5j

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))




# # Random Number
#  Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:

# A module is just a Python file (.py) that has some code in it — like functions, variables, or classes — and you can use that code in another file.



# # eg:
# import random
# print(random.randrange(1, 100))
