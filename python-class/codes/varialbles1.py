# # VARIABLES - A variable is like a container or a label that stores a value/data

# #syntax
# variable_name = data/value


# student_name = "john"
# age = 17
# fees = 15000.00
# print(student_name)
# print(age)
# print(fees)



# # 🧪 Rules for Naming Variables
# Must start with a letter or underscore

# Cannot start with a number

# Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores

# Are case-sensitive (Name and name are different)


# # ✅ Valid Variable Names:
# name = "Alice"              # Starts with a letter
# _name = "Bob"               # Starts with an underscore
# u1ser1 = "Charlie"           # Letters and digits allowed after the first character
# user_name = "David"         # Underscores are allowed
# PI = 3.14                   # Constants in uppercase 


# # ❌ Invalid Variable Names: (will cause errors)
# 1name = "Alice"             #  Starts with a number
# user-name = "Bob"           #  Hyphens are not allowed
# total$ = 100                #  Special characters like $ are not allowed
# class = "Python"            #  'class' is a reserved keyword



# # Multi Words Variable Names:
# 1.Camel Case - Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
# eg - student_Name = "Rajesh"

# 2.Pascal Case - Each word starts with a capital letter:
# eg - Student_Name = "Rajesh"

# 3.Snake Case - Each word is separated by an underscore character:
# eg - student_name = "John"


# # Many Values to Multiple Variables:
# x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)
