# ## In Python, an array is a way to store multiple values in a single variable.
# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# print(cars)

# # What is an Array?
# # An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

# # Access the Elements of an Array
# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# x = cars[0]
# print(x)


# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# cars[0] = "Toyota"
# print(cars)

# # The Length of an Array
# # Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array).

# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# x = len(cars)
# print(x)


# # Looping Array Elements
# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# for x in cars:
#   print(x)

# # Adding Array Elements
# # You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.

# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# cars.append("Honda")
# print(cars)

# # Removing Array Elements
# You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.
# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# cars.pop(1)
# print(cars)

# # You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array.

# cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# cars.remove("Volvo")
# print(cars)
