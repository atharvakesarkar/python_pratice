# # File handling alloz ws a program to store data permanently so it can be used later â€” for example, saving user information, logs, configuration settings, etc.

# a = open("file_handling/demo.txt", "r")
# print(a.read())  #to read the content

# # Using the with statement
# # You can also use the with statement when opening a file:
# with open("file_handling/demo_file.txt") as f:
#   print(f.read())


# # Close Files
# # It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.
# f = open("file_handling/demo_file.txt")
# f.close()


# # Read Only Parts of the File
# # By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:

# with open("file_handling/demo.txt") as f:
#   print(f.read(5))

# # Read Lines
# # You can return one line by using the readline() method:
# with open("file_handling/demo.txt") as f:
#   print(f.readline())

# # By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:
# with open("file_handling/demo_file.txt") as f:
#   print(f.readline())
#   print(f.readline())

# # By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:
# with open("file_handling/demo.txt") as f:
#   for x in f:
#     print(x)

# # Write to an Existing File
# with open("file_handling/demo.txt", "a") as f:
#     f.write("Now the file has more content!")  

# # # open and read the file after the appending:
# with open("file_handling/demo.txt") as f:
#   print(f.read())

# # Note: the "w" method will overwrite the entire file.

# # Overwrite Existing Content
# # To overwrite the existing content to the file, use the w parameter:
# with open("file_handling/demo.txt", "w") as f:
#   f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")

# # open and read the file after the overwriting:
# with open("file_handling/demo_file.txt") as f:
#   print(f.read())

# Create a New File
# f = open("myfile.txt", "x")

# # Delete a File
# # To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function:

# import os
# os.remove("myfile.txt")

# # Check if File exist:
# # To avoid getting an error, you might want to check if the file exists before you try to delete it:

# import os
# if os.path.exists("file_handling/demo.txt"):
#   os.remove("file_handling/demo.txt")
# else:
#   print("The file does not exist")
